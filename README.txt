ðŸ“¦ Backup Instructions
======================

To back up your entire application:

1. Close the app if itâ€™s running.
2. Go to the application folder (e.g., C:\MyApp)
3. Copy the entire folder to a USB drive or another folder as backup.

âœ… What Gets Backed Up:
- All your app files
- Local MySQL database stored by XAMPP (check mysql/data folder in XAMPP)

ðŸ’¡ Tip: You can also use XAMPP's phpMyAdmin to export the database as a .sql file for clean backups.
